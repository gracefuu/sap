this     is     a    foooo


My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh,
where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department
stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a
glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually
have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress
in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that
I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies,
like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society,
and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

This is another paragraph. I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact,
GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself,
but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities
and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
